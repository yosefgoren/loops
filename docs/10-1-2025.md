* Our current normalization scheme is based on the assumption that the different scales of NPB are similar in size.
    The issues is that though the memory footprints of the different benchmarks are the same, their computational complexity is not matched per loop.
* We should be returning to focus on the parallel efficiency, rather than normalized parallel runtime
* Since we will not be using NPB exclusively, we can also collect information using HeCBench. For collecting this benchmark, consider:
    ```
    Although HeCBench is a benchmark suite for heterogeneous environments, its
    OpenMP benchmarks could be compiled for CPU-only environment using make
    DEVICE=cpu.
